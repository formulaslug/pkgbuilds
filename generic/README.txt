Call "./build-arm-none-eabi-gcc.sh" to build the toolchain. By default, the whole toolchain will be built and installed in build/pkg. After that, add that directory to your PATH environment variable.

Specifying an argument of "binutils", "gcc-stage1", "newlib", "gcc", or "gdb" will build and install just that component instead.
